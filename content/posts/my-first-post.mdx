# Understanding React Hooks

React Hooks were introduced in **React 16.8** to bring the power of state and
side effects to functional components‚Äîwithout the need for classes. They are
special functions that let you ‚Äúhook into‚Äù React features directly from function
components.

## üöÄ Why Hooks?

Before Hooks, managing state and lifecycle logic in React required class
components. Hooks solve multiple issues:

- Code reuse was difficult between components (HOCs and render props became
  messy).
- Component logic was harder to organize and test.
- Classes brought added complexity (binding, `this`, etc).

With Hooks, you get:

- **Cleaner and more readable code**
- **Reusable logic via custom hooks**
- **Better separation of concerns**

## üîß Basic Hooks

React provides several built-in hooks. The most commonly used include:

### 1. useState

Adds state to a functional component.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0) // Initialize count with 0

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>You clicked {count} times</h2>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```
